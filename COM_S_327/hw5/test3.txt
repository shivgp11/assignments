For
this
assignment
you
will
build
and
manipulate
terminated
arrays
of
unsigned
integers
in
C
Write
a
function
to
build
and
return
the
prime
factorization
of
an
unsigned
integer
as
a
pointer
to
a
dynamically
allocated
from
the
heap
array
of
integers
The
array
should
have
value
as
its
last
element
The
prototype
should
be
unsigned
build_factors
unsigned
For
example
if
the
function
should
return
a
newly
allocated
array
of
size
with
elements
Note
that
the
elements
should
be
in
order
except
for
the
final
Since
the
size
of
the
array
will
not
be
known
until
you
determine
the
factors
you
may
use
a
large
say
element
array
to
build
the
factors
and
then
either
resize
the
array
if
it
was
allocated
from
the
heap
or
copy
the
array
For
the
edge
cases
and
return
a
pointer
Write
a
function
to
display
to
standard
output
the
elements
of
a
terminated
array
not
including
the
terminating
zero
Elements
should
be
separated
by
commas
The
prototype
should
be
void
show_array
unsigned
A
For
example
if
then
the
characters
should
be
written
If
A
is
a
pointer
then
write
nothing
Write
a
function
that
takes
two
terminated
arrays
of
factors
and
builds
and
returns
a
new
terminated
array
of
factors
that
contains
the
common
elements
of
the
input
arrays
More
formally
if
value
appears
times
in
the
first
array
and
appears
times
in
the
second
array
then
should
appear
in
the
output
array
is
the
minimum
of
The
prototype
should
be
unsigned
build_common
unsigned
A
unsigned
B
For
example
if
then
the
function
should
return
a
newly
allocated
array
of
size
with
elements
Again
you
may
use
a
temporary
array
to
build
the
result
and
then
copy
or
resize
If
either
input
is
a
pointer
return
a
pointer
Write
a
main
program
that
prompts
the
user
for
two
integers
M
and
N
and
displays
to
standard
output
their
individual
factors
and
their
common
factors
For
example
Enter
two
integers
M
N
has
factors
has
factors
and
have
common
factors
Collect
all
this
together
into
a
single
file
factors
c
complete
with
documentation
including
your
name
and
upload
it
to
Canvas
Your
code
will
be
compiled
and
tested
on
pyrite
